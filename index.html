          Since the coup on the 22nd of May, 2014, Thai people have been forced to live under the control of junta government (military dictatorship). The military government has been exercising extreme and incontestable state power to silence and control thai people for 6 long years. Speaking up costs a lot in this country. Brave activists and students who have come forward to voice their rightful critique against the junta have faced dire consequences : some were threatened, some were attacked, and some were forced to disappear.
          <br>Freedom of speech and expression has been stolen from the people by the junta by violently cracking down on dissent, actively enforcing media censorship, and banning public gatherings. The current constitution, drafted under the heavy influence of the military and enacted in 2017, allows authoritarianism and abuse of power to thrive even further, at the price of thai people’s liberty and basic human rights. The law and the corrupt justice system has been weaponised by the military to serve the ruling class and demolish the less fortunate.
          <br>Since speaking the truth here may cost thai people's lives and those of people they hold dear, they need help and support from the global citizens to spread our words and let our voices be heard. The world needs to know what really is happening in Thailand.
